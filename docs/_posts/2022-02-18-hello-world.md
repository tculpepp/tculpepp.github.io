# Hello World!

## First post, and lots to learn.

I actually built this site back in December of last year, but it unfortunately had to wait until now for me to find the time to finish some config details and make this first post. Hopefully before too long this will settle out and I'll be able to just create posts/articles and just the occasional background admin item. In the meantime I feel like I've got a laundry list of to-do's. Here's a few of them in no particular order:

- **find a better theme**, the default minima isn't bad, and it get things up and going. I'd be lying if I said I would've picked it out of a gallery though.
  - **learn to add and update themes in Jekyll** I figure this one is pretty important to the success of the previous bullet
- **explore jekyll** at this point I know that Jekyll has a LOT of options and I'm just scratching the surface (barely even that). I'm sure some of them will be more useful/interesting than others, but I don;t even know what they are at this point.
- **start posting more often** should go without saying that once every two months is not exactly active content. I'm not looking for pure quantity, but on the off chance that someone else every reads this I think somewhat active posting would be polite.
- **find an audience** I'm hoping to share my learning and learn from others along the way. If no one is looking then the learning from others isn't really happening.

I feel like that list came out a bit shorter than it felt in my head. I'm going to have to ponder than one a bit more. It's probably the litany of sub-bullets I'm missing that are making it feel bigger to me. 

Well, that's post #1, time to get it online. (If you are reading this, I figured that part out!)
